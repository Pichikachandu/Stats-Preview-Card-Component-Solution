- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I Learned

This project improved my understanding of CSS Flexbox and responsive design. Here are a few highlights:

```html
<h1>Get <span>insights</span> that help your business grow.</h1>
```

```css
.main-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: fit-content;
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 90rem;
  transition: all .4s ease-in-out;
}
```

### Continued Development

I plan to continue working on:

- Improving image masking techniques for better UI design.
- Enhancing responsiveness using CSS Grid.

### Useful Resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Responsive Design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design) - Great resource for responsive design basics.
